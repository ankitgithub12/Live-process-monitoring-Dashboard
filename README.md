# Live-process-monitoring-Dashboard
A Live Process Monitoring Dashboard is a graphical tool that provides real-time insights into system processes, CPU usage, memory consumption, and other system performance metrics. It enables users to monitor and manage running processes efficiently, helping in system diagnostics and performance optimization.
**1. Project Overview**

The Live Process Monitoring Dashboard is a web-based application that tracks and displays real-time data for various processes. It provides an interactive and visual representation of system metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, and other critical performance indicators. The goal is to enable administrators and users to monitor live processes efficiently, receive alerts for anomalies, and analyze trends over time.

**Expected Outcomes**

A real-time dashboard for monitoring live system processes.

Interactive data visualization for enhanced insights.

Alerts and notifications for threshold breaches.

Historical data tracking for analysis and decision-making.

**Scope**

The project will focus on real-time monitoring of system processes and data visualization. The dashboard will support integration with various data sources, including APIs, databases, and IoT devices.

**2. Module-Wise Breakdown**

The project consists of three core modules:

**1. Data Collection & Processing Module**

Purpose: Collects real-time system data and processes it for visualization.
Roles:

Fetches live system metrics (CPU, memory, network, etc.).

Stores historical data for analysis.

Detects anomalies and triggers alerts.

**2. Data Visualization Module**

Purpose: Converts raw data into meaningful visual representations.
Roles:

Displays real-time graphs and charts.

Provides filtering and historical comparison.

Implements user-friendly UI components.

**3. User Interface & Alerting Module**

Purpose: Allows users to interact with the dashboard and receive notifications.
Roles:

Provides an intuitive UI for monitoring.

Implements alert mechanisms (email, SMS, pop-ups).

Supports user authentication and role-based access control.

**3. Functionalities**

**Data Collection & Processing Module**

Fetch real-time system metrics.

Store and retrieve data for historical analysis.

Implement WebSockets for real-time updates.

**Data Visualization Module**

Interactive charts and graphs (CPU, memory, network usage).

Customizable dashboards with multiple data views.

Heatmaps for anomaly detection.

**User Interface & Alerting Module**

User-friendly interface with responsive design.

Role-based access control and authentication.

**4. Technology Used**

Programming Languages:

Python (Flask/Django) for backend.

JavaScript (React.js) for frontend.

**Libraries and Tools:**

Flask-SocketIO for real-time updates.

PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

Chart.js/D3.js for data visualization.

**Other Tools:**

GitHub for version control.

Postman for API testing.
